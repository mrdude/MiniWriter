What is this?
-------------

An uber simple fullscreen text-editor.
Think of it as a Java version of [Q10](http://www.baara.com/q10/) with less features (because that's basically what it is).

How do I use it?
----------------

```
java -jar writer.jar
```

will create a file named 'miniwriter.txt' and save to that.

```
java -jar writer.jar <filename>
```

will load a file named <filename>, creating it if it doesn't exist.

CTRL+S will save the file, and Esc will quit the program. The file is autosaved every 5 minutes and before shutdown.

What features do you plan to add?
---------------------------------

None. This is a tool I created for personal use, and it has all the features I want/need. It's licensed under the MIT
License, so feel free to fork and add any features you may want.
